Part backorders is a common supply chain problem. Working to identify parts at risk of backorder before the event occurs so the business has time to react. Data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data was taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week.
went_on_backorder - Product actually went on backorder or not. This is the target value.
I have uploaded train data in two parts beacause of its size, one can download and merge both train data to build thier models.
